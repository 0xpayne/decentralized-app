# Decentralized Application Playground
Introducing myself to decentralized applications using Ethereum. An objective of this will be to leverage distributed computing for self-similar shapes, and decentralized storage for results stashing, as an exercise to get a sense of how blockchain works. The mapping is Level (int) => Line Positions (Line[], where Line is a struct containing [x1,y1], [x2,y2], and string "color").

Pure JS functionality is in koch.js; index.js utilizes the smart contract from koch.sol. Contract functionality is in progress.

Output should look like this:
